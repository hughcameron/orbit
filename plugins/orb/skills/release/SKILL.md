# /orb:release

Release a new version of the orbit plugin so `/reload-plugins` picks up changes.

## Why This Exists

The Claude Code plugin system caches plugins by version. If you add skills, hooks, or scripts without bumping the version in `plugin.json`, `/reload-plugins` sees the same version and skips the update. This skill ensures the version bump, commit, push, and cache refresh all happen together.

## Usage

```
/orb:release <bump>
```

Where `<bump>` is one of:
- `patch` (default) — e.g. 0.2.2 → 0.2.3
- `minor` — e.g. 0.2.3 → 0.3.0
- `major` — e.g. 0.3.0 → 1.0.0

If no argument is given, default to `patch`.

## Instructions

### 1. Pre-flight Checks

Run these checks in the orbit repo at `~/github/hughcameron/orbit`:

1. `git status` — must be clean (no uncommitted changes). If dirty, stop and tell the user to commit first.
2. `git log --oneline -5` — show recent commits so the user can verify what's being released.
3. Read `plugins/orb/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to get the current version.

### 2. Generate Changelog Entry

Collect the commits since the last version bump:

```bash
git log --oneline $(git log --oneline --all --grep="Bump version to" -1 --format=%H)..HEAD
```

Summarise these commits into a changelog entry following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format, grouped by `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed` as applicable. Write concise, user-facing descriptions — not commit messages verbatim.

Prepend the new entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (after the header, before the previous release). Use today's date.

### 3. Bump the Version

Parse the current version string (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and apply the requested bump:

- `patch`: increment PATCH
- `minor`: increment MINOR, reset PATCH to 0
- `major`: increment MAJOR, reset MINOR and PATCH to 0

Update `plugins/orb/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with the new version.

### 4. Commit and Push

```bash
cd ~/github/hughcameron/orbit
git add plugins/orb/.claude-plugin/plugin.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Bump version to <new_version>"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Update the Marketplace Cache

Pull the latest into the marketplace repo that Claude Code reads from:

```bash
git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/orbit pull origin main
```

### 6. Update the Install Record

The file `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` tracks which version and cache path is active. If it still points to the old version, `/reload-plugins` will load from the old cache and miss new skills.

Update the `orb@orbit` entry:
- `installPath` → point to the new version cache directory (e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/cache/orbit/orb/<new_version>`)
- `version` → the new version string
- `gitCommitSha` → the new HEAD SHA from the marketplace repo (`git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/orbit rev-parse HEAD`)
- `lastUpdated` → current ISO 8601 timestamp

### 7. Confirm

Tell the user:

```
Released orbit v<new_version>.
Run /reload-plugins to pick up the new version.
```

Show the changelog entry that was just added.
